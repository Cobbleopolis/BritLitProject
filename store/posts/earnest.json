I also told him the real reason I even came: to propose to the lovely Gwendolen. Algy caught me in a lie, and I had to tell him of the double life I lead. And then my plans to marry Gwen were ruined by her mother, Lady Bracknell! Damn old lady. I do have some hope in being able to be with Gwen though, as I have a couple of tricks up my sleeve.</p>"

And to think that I considered him my friend, and for him to just come over here and complicate things by claiming that HE is my brother! Then, of course, Gwen shows up and meets Cecily before I have a chance to intervene. They both come to me and Algy and discover what is actually going on. This was a huge mess and I cannot believe that I let it get out of hand like this. Algy is a dirty muffin eater by the way.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Literally what. Apparently I am Algy's older brother, and Lady Bracknell was hiding that from me all along. So she's my aunt, which means that Gwen&hellip;is still the love of my life! Algy and I are now brothers, Gwen is marrying me, and Cecily is marrying Algy. It's great how it all worked out in the end despite what I can only describe as a roller coaster of emotions and reveals. I now know that I am amazing, and the importance of doin' it to 'em.</p>"
